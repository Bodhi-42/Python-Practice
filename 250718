# Decode the Alien Dictionary
# An alien language uses the same alphabet as English, but the words are sorted in a custom, unknown order. You are given a list of words sorted according to the alien dictionary. Your task is to deduce the order of letters in the alien alphabet.

def alien_order(words: list[str]) -> str:
    alphabets = ""
    alphabets_sorted = ""
    
    for word in words:
        for c in word:
            if c not in alphabets:
                alphabets += c

    while len(alphabets) > 0:
        for c in alphabets:
            is_first = True
            for word in words:
                if c in word:
                    if c == word[0]:
                        pass
                    else:
                        is_first = False
                        break
                else:
                    pass
            if is_first:
                alphabets_sorted += c
                alphabets = alphabets.replace(c, "")
